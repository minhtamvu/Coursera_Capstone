    "A businessman from Toronto, Canada would like to open a coffee shop in his city. There are two questions are raised as: (1) Which neighbourhood will be chosen?; and (2) After choosing a neighbourhood, which specific location should be chosen to open the coffee shop. \n",
    "In order to answers these questions, he needs to consider the following things:\n",
    "- In general, do people in Toronto like coffee and what are their habits for drinking coffee? If they like coffee, where they prefer to enjoy coffee such as caf√© or home or office?\n",
    "- At the smaller scale, which neighbourhood in Toronto seems to consume highest coffee production? Then, he should identify the potential place for opening the coffee shop. "
